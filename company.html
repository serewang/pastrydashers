            <div class="maincontent company" id="skip">
                <p>We, the Pastry Dashers, are a company that prides themselves on the integrity and perfection of our macarons. Baked to perfection, we make sure that each and every pastry comes out to the highest standards so our valued customers get what they deserve. We source the finest ingredients from the farthest corners of the Earth - our water, for example, is sourced from the peaks of the tallest mountains in the world for the highest purity attainable. That is the least that you, our valued customer, should receive.</p>

                <p>In truth, the people behind this website are not pastry chefs. Far from it, actually. In fact, there is only one person behind this website. It is me, Serena Wang. Maybe you are wondering why I decided to code a fake website about macarons. To be truthful, I just like cute and pastel concepts, and macarons fit perfectly with that.</p>

                        <p>23 years old, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America</p> 
                        <p>Emily loves making pastries, macarons especially! She hopes you enjoy her creations.</p>

                <p>And no, I don't know the people in these photos. They look cute and hard at work though! I applaud their effort. If they ever need a website, tell them to hit me up. I already got one right here. I can just change things up in the code to fit their needs, and boom! A pretty decent website, if I do say so myself. Thank you for reading this far, if you have. I hope my ramblings were entertaining at the very least. When the pastry chefs do eventually hit me up to code them a website, you will no longer see this text, hopefully. Bye now :)</p>
